# AI-Powered AMT Migration Automation

An intelligent, AI-driven solution for automating application migration tasks using Azure services and C#/.NET technologies.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Traditional Experion application migrations are slow, complex, and labor-intensive, often involving multi-week timelines, significant downtime risks, and manual procedures. This project aims to streamline the entire migration process using AI and automation, reducing migration time from weeks to days with almost zero downtime and no data corruption.

## üéØ Key Objectives
