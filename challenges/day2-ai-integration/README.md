**Step 5: Integrate Function with AI Agent (5 minutes)**
1. Navigate to Azure AI Foundry ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí "Agents"
2. Select your **InfrastructureAssessmentAgent** or create a new agent
3. In the agent configuration, scroll to "Tools" section
4. Click "Add" ‚Üí "OpenAPI Specified Tool"
5. Configure the PowerShell Function tool:
   - **OpenAPI spec**: Paste the YAML specification from Step 4
   - **Connection**: Leave blank (use Function App's public endpoint)
   - **Tool name**: `infrastructure_assessor`
   - **Description**: "Execute PowerShell scripts to assess server infrastructure"
6. Update agent instructions to include the new capability:

```
You are an infrastructure assessment specialist. You can:

1. Analyze infrastructure configurations and recommend Azure service mappings
2. Execute real-time PowerShell-based infrastructure assessments using the infrastructure_assessor tool
3. Provide detailed technical recommendations based on live server data

When assessing infrastructure:
- Use the infrastructure_assessor tool to get real-time server status
- Specify appropriate CheckType based on assessment needs:
  - connectivity: Check if server is reachable
  - resources: Get CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - compatibility: Verify Azure migration compatibility
  - general: Overall health assessment

Always provide actionable recommendations based on the PowerShell assessment results.
```

**Step 6: Test Complete Integration**
1. In the agent playground, test the PowerShell integration:
   ```
   Please assess the infrastructure status of server PROD-SQL01. 
   I need to know about its resource utilization and Azure migration compatibility.
   ```

2. Verify the agent:
   - Calls the PowerShell function via the infrastructure_assessor tool
   - Receives structured JSON response with server details
   - Provides intelligent analysis based on the PowerShell results
   - Offers migration recommendations using real server data

**Advanced PowerShell Scenarios (Optional)**
You can extend this pattern for other migration tasks:

- **Database Assessment**: PowerShell scripts to check SQL Server compatibility
- **Application Discovery**: Scripts to inventory installed applications
- **Network Configuration**: Scripts to assess network requirements
- **Security Compliance**: Scripts to check security policies and configurations

**Security Considerations**:
- Configure Function App authentication for production use
- Use Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive credentials
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Restrict Function App network access as needed
