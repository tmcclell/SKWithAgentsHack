# Day 2: AI Integration - Connected Agents & Advanced Tools

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you will:
- Build connected multi-agent systems using Azure AI Foundry
- Implement advanced tools including Bing Custom Search and OpenAPI integrations
- Create specialized agents with sophisticated tool orchestration
- Use Agent Catalog templates to accelerate development

## üìö Key Concepts

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG combines large language models with external knowledge retrieval to provide more accurate, up-to-date responses. In migration scenarios, RAG enables agents to access specific documentation, best practices, and organizational knowledge bases to make informed recommendations. Azure AI Foundry implements RAG through vector stores and knowledge bases, allowing agents to search and retrieve relevant information before generating responses.

### Vector Stores
Vector stores enable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by storing and retrieving relevant information to enhance agent responses. In Azure AI Foundry, vector stores create searchable knowledge bases from uploaded documents, allowing agents to access specific migration documentation, best practices, and organizational knowledge. This ensures agents provide accurate, contextually relevant recommendations based on your specific migration scenarios and requirements rather than relying solely on general training data.

**Vector Stores vs. Traditional Storage**:
- **Vector Stores**: Store documents as high-dimensional mathematical vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based search and retrieval. When an agent queries "database migration risks," the vector store finds semantically similar content even if it uses different terminology like "data transfer vulnerabilities."
- **Traditional Storage**: Store documents as files or records with keyword-based search capabilities. Retrieval depends on exact keyword matches, making it less effective for understanding context and intent in natural language queries.

Vector stores provide superior contextual understanding for AI agents by matching the semantic intent of queries rather than relying on exact keyword matches.

### Connected Agents
Connected agents enable collaborative multi-agent systems where a main agent intelligently delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents without requiring custom orchestration code. This modular approach improves reliability, traceability, and extensibility for complex workflows.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)
A2A enables autonomous agents to communicate and coordinate without human intervention. In Azure AI Foundry's connected agent architecture, a main orchestrator agent delegates specialized tasks to sub-agents (like Infrastructure Assessment, Risk Analysis, Migration Planning) and receives structured responses. This creates collaborative workflows where each agent contributes domain expertise while maintaining clear boundaries, essential for scalable migration automation through intelligent task distribution and result synthesis.

**Why A2A is Significant**:
- **Scalability**: Enables complex migration workflows to be broken down into manageable, specialized tasks that can be processed in parallel
- **Reliability**: Reduces single points of failure by distributing responsibilities across multiple specialized agents
- **Maintainability**: Allows individual agents to be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system
- **Expertise Isolation**: Each agent can focus on its specific domain (infrastructure, risk, planning) without needing to understand other domains
- **Reusability**: Specialized agents can be reused across different migration scenarios and projects
- **Traceability**: Provides clear audit trails of which agent handled which aspect of the migration analysis

### Agent Catalog Templates
Azure AI Foundry provides pre-built agent templates for common scenarios including browser automation, compliance checking, healthcare workflows, and research tasks. These templates accelerate development with proven patterns and best practices.

### Advanced Tools
- **Bing Custom Search**: Domain-specific search capabilities with configurable sources
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Standardized API connectivity with authentication and security controls

{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "Migration Cost Calculator API",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "API for calculating Azure migration costs and recommendations"

                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

   ```
   
   > **Note**: This example uses JSONPlaceholder (a free testing API) to demonstrate the integration. In a real scenario, you would use your actual migration API with proper authentication.

**Step 2: Add OpenAPI Tool to Existing Agent (15 minutes)**
1. Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) and select your AI Project
2. Go to "Agents" section and select your agent from Walkthrough 2.1
3. Click "Edit" to modify the existing agent
4. Scroll down to the "Tools" section
5. Click "Add" ‚Üí "OpenAPI Specified Tool"
6. Configure the OpenAPI tool:
   - **OpenAPI spec**: Upload or paste your YAML specification from Step 1
   - **Connection**: Leave blank for anonymous APIs (like JSONPlaceholder)
   - **Tool name**: `cost_calculator`
   - **Description**: "Calculate migration costs and provide estimates"
7. Click "Add tool" to save

**Step 3: Update Agent Instructions (10 minutes)**
1. In the same agent editing view, update the "Instructions" field to include the new capability:
   ```
   You are an infrastructure assessment specialist focused on analyzing legacy systems and mapping them to Azure services. Your capabilities include:
   
   1. Analyze infrastructure configurations and recommend Azure service mappings
   2. Assess resource requirements and performance considerations
   3. Calculate migration costs using the cost calculator tool
   4. Provide detailed technical recommendations with cost implications
   
   When analyzing infrastructure:
   - Always consider both technical feasibility and cost optimization
   - Use the cost calculator tool to provide realistic budget estimates
   - Include specific Azure service recommendations with SKU suggestions
   - Consider compliance, security, and performance requirements
   
   When using the cost calculator, format the infrastructure details clearly in the request body.
   ```

2. Click "Save" to update the agent

**Step 4: Test Enhanced Agent with OpenAPI Tool (5 minutes)**
1. Click "Try in playground" from your updated agent
2. Test the enhanced functionality with a comprehensive query:
   ```
   Analyze this infrastructure and provide a cost estimate:
   
   Infrastructure:
   - 3 Windows Server 2019 VMs (8 cores, 16GB RAM each)
   - 1 SQL Server 2017 database (4 cores, 32GB RAM, 1TB storage)
   - Load balancer and network configuration
   - Requirements: High availability, backup strategy, monitoring
   
   Please assess the infrastructure and calculate migration costs for this scenario.
   ```

3. Observe how the agent:
   - Provides infrastructure analysis (existing capability)
   - Calls the OpenAPI tool to calculate costs (new capability)
   - Synthesizes both results into comprehensive recommendations

4. Verify the agent successfully uses both its original assessment capabilities and the new cost calculation tool

**Alternative Authentication Methods (Optional)**
For APIs requiring authentication, you can set up:

1. **API Key Authentication**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Connected resources ‚Üí + New connection
   - Select "Custom keys" and configure your API key
   - Reference the connection in your OpenAPI tool configuration

2. **Managed Identity Authentication**:
   - Enable system-assigned managed identity on your Azure AI Service
   - Grant permissions to your target API resource
   - Configure your OpenAPI spec for managed identity authentication
