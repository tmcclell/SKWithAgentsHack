# Validation Checks for PLC Controller Firmware Upgrade

## Objective
Ensure that the firmware upgrade on PLC controllers has been successfully applied and the system is functioning as expected.

## Validation Checklist
- [x] Device boots successfully with new firmware
- [x] Firmware version matches expected release
- [x] All I/O modules are detected and operational
- [x] Communication protocols are functioning (e.g., Modbus, Ethernet/IP)
- [x] Custom logic executes without errors
- [x] No critical errors in system logs
- [x] Backup configuration is restored correctly

## Test Procedures
1. **Power Cycle Test**: Reboot the device and verify startup behavior.
2. **Firmware Version Check**: Use diagnostic tool to confirm firmware version.
3. **I/O Module Test**: Simulate input signals and verify output responses.
4. **Network Communication Test**: Ping device and test protocol communication.
5. **Logic Execution Test**: Run test sequences to validate custom logic.
6. **Log Review**: Inspect system logs for warnings or errors.

## Expected Outcomes
- Device should boot without errors
- Firmware version should match the upgrade target
- All modules and interfaces should be operational
- No unexpected behavior or error messages
