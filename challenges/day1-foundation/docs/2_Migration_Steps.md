# Migration Steps for PLC Controller Firmware Upgrade

## Objective
Provide a step-by-step guide to upgrade embedded devices with the latest software updates.

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- Confirm device compatibility
- Notify stakeholders of planned downtime
- Backup all configurations and logs
- Ensure access to required tools and firmware files
- Verify power supply and network stability

## Migration Procedure
1. **Connect to Device**: Use USB or Ethernet interface to establish a connection with the PLC controller.
2. **Authenticate Access**: Log in using administrator credentials.
3. **Upload New Firmware**: Launch the Firmware Uploader Tool and select the appropriate firmware version.
4. **Verify Upload**: Confirm checksum and version match before proceeding.
5. **Apply Configuration**: Restore backed-up configuration files to the device.
6. **Reboot Device**: Restart the PLC to apply the new firmware.
7. **Run Diagnostics**: Use diagnostic tools to verify system health and firmware integrity.

## Post-Migration Tasks
- Log firmware version, device ID, and timestamp of upgrade
- Notify stakeholders of successful migration
- Monitor device performance for 24 hours
- Document any anomalies or issues encountered
