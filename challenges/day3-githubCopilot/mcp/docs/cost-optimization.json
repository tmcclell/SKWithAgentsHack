  "content": "Optimizing Azure infrastructure costs requires continuous monitoring and strategic planning: 1) Right-sizing resources based on actual usage patterns and performance metrics, 2) Implementing Azure Reserved Instances for predictable workloads with 1-3 year commitments, 3) Using Azure Spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads at up to 90% discount, 4) Configuring auto-scaling to match resource allocation with demand patterns, 5) Implementing Azure Cost Management alerts and budgets for proactive monitoring, 6) Leveraging Azure Advisor recommendations for optimization opportunities, 7) Regular cost reviews and resource cleanup procedures. Typical cost savings range from 20-40% with proper optimization strategies.",
