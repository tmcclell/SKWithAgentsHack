**Day 2**: âœ… AI-powered migration planning and decision engine
**Day 3**: âœ… Automated infrastructure deployment and migration workflows
**Day 4**: âœ… Production-ready solution with monitoring and security

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Cost Management
- Use Azure Free Tier resources when possible
- Clean up resources after each day if not needed
- Set up cost alerts to monitor spending

### Learning Approach
- Read the entire day's README before starting
- Complete challenges in order (they build on each other)
- Experiment beyond the basic requirements
- Document your learnings and insights

### Getting Help
- Check the troubleshooting sections in each README
- Use Azure documentation for detailed service information
- Leverage GitHub Discussions for community support
- Create GitHub Issues for technical problems

## ðŸ”§ Essential Commands

### Azure CLI Essentials
```bash
# List all resource groups
az group list --output table

# View resource deployment status in portal
Portal â†’ Resource groups â†’ "rg-migration-hackathon" â†’ Check deployment status

# Clean up resources via portal  
Portal â†’ Resource groups â†’ "rg-migration-hackathon" â†’ Delete resource group
```

### Portal Navigation Essentials
- **Resource Groups**: Organize and manage related resources
- **Search Bar**: Quick access to any Azure service or resource
- **Favorites**: Pin frequently used services to sidebar
- **Cloud Shell**: Built-in terminal (if needed for advanced scenarios)
- **Resource Graph Explorer**: Query across all resources

### Workspace Management
- Save portal configurations as custom dashboards
- Use resource group tags for organization
- Set up cost alerts and budgets
- Configure access controls (RBAC)

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Begin!

You're all set! Navigate to `challenges/day1-foundation/README.md` and start your portal-based AI migration automation journey.

**Remember**: This hackathon focuses on using Azure Portal for all configuration and setup. The goal is to understand the portal workflows and build practical skills without writing code.

Good luck! ðŸš€
