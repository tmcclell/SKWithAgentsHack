## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Cost Management
- Use Azure Free Tier resources when possible
- Monitor Azure OpenAI token usage and set limits
- Clean up resources after each day if not needed
- Set up cost alerts to monitor spending

### Learning Approach
- Read the entire day's README before starting
- Complete challenges in order (they build on each other)
- Test each agent thoroughly before moving to next challenge
- Document your learnings and agent configurations

### Migration Domain Focus
- Reference the sample PLC controller data in `challenges/day1-foundation/docs/`
- Practice with realistic enterprise migration scenarios
- Focus on risk assessment and validation workflows
- Consider downtime and rollback strategies

### Getting Help
- Check the troubleshooting sections in each README
- Use Azure AI Foundry documentation for agent best practices
- Leverage GitHub Discussions for community support
- Create GitHub Issues for technical problems

## ðŸ”§ Essential Commands

### Azure CLI Essentials
```bash
# List all resource groups
az group list --output table
