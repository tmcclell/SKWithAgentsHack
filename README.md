# SKWithAgentsHack - Semantic Kernel & AI Agents Migration Automation

An intelligent, AI-driven s## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Azure subscription with AI services enabled
   - Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022
   - .NET 8.0 SDK
   - Git and GitHub account

2. **Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmcclell/SKWithAgentsHack.git
   cd SKWithAgentsHack
   ```

3. **Get the Most From This Hackathon**
   - Review `QUICK-START.md` for detailed setup and daily expectations
   - Engage with real migration scenarios in `challenges/day1-foundation/docs/`
   - Don't hesitate to ask questions during demos and hands-on sessions
   - Collaborate and share discoveries with fellow participantsting enterprise migration tasks using **Semantic Kernel**, **Azure AI Foundry Agents**, **Azure AI services**, and **GitHub Copilot Agents**. This hackathon project demonstrates how to build sophisticated AI-powered automation tools for complex migration scenarios.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive training platform that teaches developers how to build AI-powered migration automation solutions using:

- **Semantic Kernel** for AI orchestration and function calling
- **Azure AI Foundry Agents** for specialized AI agents with domain expertise  
- **Connected multi-agent systems** for collaborative AI workflows
- **Advanced AI tools** including AI search, Bing Search, vector assistant, and API integration
- **Getting Started with GitHub Copilot Agents and MCP**

The project transforms traditional manual migration processes (which can take weeks) into intelligent, automated workflows that complete in days with minimal downtime and reduced risk.

We will be simulating an Azure migration during this hack. After each learning session, please use what you've learned to build a solution for the migration services we are looking to build. Apply the exercises to the real world example. 

**Come back and ask questions.**

## üìö Hackathon Structure & Expectations

This is organized as a **4-day progressive hackathon** with hands-on challenges. Each day combines learning with practical application in a collaborative environment.

### üéì Daily Format & Expectations

**Daily Schedule:**
- **~1 Hour**: Demos, explanations, and Q&A about previous day's tutorials
- **Remaining Time**: Hands-on learning, experimentation, and implementation

**Learning Mindset:**
- **Embrace the Journey**: Things might not be perfect, and we'll encounter obstacles - that's part of the learning process!
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: We'll face challenges together as a team and help each other overcome them
- **Discovery & Adaptation**: While we aim for smooth service configurations, we'll uncover issues and gain clarity to move forward together
- **Real-World Focus**: Examples use actual enterprise migration scenarios (PLC controllers, legacy systems) to make the learning meaningful and applicable

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Your Facilitator

**Tammy McClellan** will be guiding you through this hackathon journey. With extensive experience working on manufacturing plants floors. I have expertise in Azure AI services, enterprise migrations, and developer education, Tammy brings both technical depth and practical insights to help you navigate the complexities of building AI-powered automation solutions. Her approach emphasizes hands-on learning, collaborative problem-solving, and building production-ready skills that you can apply in real-world scenarios.

### üéØ Learning Philosophy

This hackathon is designed to be:
- **Practical over Perfect**: Focus on building working solutions rather than flawless implementations
- **Collaborative**: Learn from each other's approaches and challenges
- **Iterative**: Build understanding progressively, with each day reinforcing previous concepts
- **Real-World Oriented**: Use migration scenarios to understand practical applications
