# SKWithAgentsHack - Semantic Kernel & AI Agents Migration Automation

An intelligent, AI-driven solution for automating enterprise migration tasks using **Semantic Kernel**, **Azure AI Foundry Agents**, and **Azure AI services**. This hackathon project demonstrates how to build sophisticated AI-powered automation tools for complex migration scenarios.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive training platform that teaches developers how to build AI-powered migration automation solutions using:

- **Semantic Kernel** for AI orchestration and function calling
- **Azure AI Foundry Agents** for specialized AI agents with domain expertise  
- **Connected multi-agent systems** for collaborative AI workflows
- **Advanced AI tools** including custom search, document analysis, and API integration

The project transforms traditional manual migration processes (which can take weeks) into intelligent, automated workflows that complete in days with minimal downtime and reduced risk.
